Author: SIU Sai Cheong (May 2023)

## Abstract

ChatGPT, an innovative chatbot powered by advanced large language models such as GPT-3.5 and developed by OpenAI, has attracted significant interest across a range of industries. With the more recent release of GPT-4, the field of language understanding and generation continues to progress rapidly. In this article, we delve into the use cases, strengths, and limitations of both ChatGPT and GPT-4, assessing their potential impact within the context of the translation industry. We emphasize the potential benefits these platforms offer to language professionals, while underlining the ongoing need for human expertise. Furthermore, we provide recommendations for practitioners to adapt to the emergence of these tools and suggest avenues for future development. Our work aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of the role of ChatGPT and GPT-4 within the translation sector, and encourage informed discussions about their potential and implications.
